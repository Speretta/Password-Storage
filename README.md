## Why did you create such a system?

You are probably tired of ```expensive``` and ```unsafe``` password storage apps ðŸ˜¡. I thought of developing such a system for my experience and my own health.

## Why are you using Dropbox API?

I don't have money. I chose Dropbox because it was ~~_secure_~~ and there was no other data storage system that would ```allow anyone to easily store data.``` And It's free ðŸ˜‹

## Why should I use this?

My whole goal is to collect you poor guys f**king Facebook passwords ðŸ˜³. Of course, you may not use it, and let FirstPass f*ck you.

## How do I start server?

You need the ```http-server```, npm package to start the server. 

# Where can I donate to you?

I don't think my projects are that good right now ðŸ˜­
